# eventU

eventU is a platform that allows university entities (clubs, fraternities, etc.) to efficiently advertise their events to students.
Students and other university entities select a specific university along with their account type (Student or Club) during registration. These users can only view or create events for that specific university.

1) University entities are able to:
   * Create a profile page
   * Create events or modify their events
   * See the number of students who favorited their events
 
2) Students are able to: 
   * Register and Log in via their school email
   * View profile pages to receive more information about different university entities
   * View events that are happening in a timeline or a calendar format
   * Favorite events they are interested in so that they can get a reminder when the event starts
